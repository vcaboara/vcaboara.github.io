## Executive Overview

Arboreum Commercial Solutions LLC (ACS) provides the **12/17 Standard**, a proprietary industrial framework for replacing virgin timber with agricultural waste in paper, packaging, and structural fiber production.

This protocol is engineered to solve the immediate "Material Sovereignty" crisis facing global supply chains due to escalating regulatory mandates in California (SB 54, SB 253/261), the U.S. Federal level (EPA TSCA), and the European Union (PPWR).

### The 12/17 Core Advantage

* **Zero Virgin Timber:** 1:1 replacement using annual agricultural waste (rice/wheat straw).
* **Energy Sovereignty:** Net-positive thermal recovery providing **~1500 kWh/ton surplus** via ORC integration.
* **PFAS-Free Sovereignty:** Native "Clean-Start" feedstock bypasses the historical contamination found in recycled streams.
* **Carbon Negative:** Verified Scope 3 data for mandatory climate disclosures.
