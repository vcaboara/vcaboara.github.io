    <h1>THE 12/17/25 STANDARD</h1>
    <p>Universal Protocol for Virgin Timber Displacement (VTD)</p>

    <p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong> The 12/17/25 Standard provides a verified, carbon-negative path for the
        global
        packaging industry to transition from high-risk virgin timber to agricultural waste feedstocks.</p>

    <h3>I. Regulatory Interoperability</h3>
    <p>The 12/17/25 Standard acts as a compliance bridge for SB 54, EU PPWR, and PFAS-Free mandates.</p>

    <h3>II. The 15/15 Licensing Model</h3>
    <p>Managed exclusively via ACS (Arboreum Commercial Solutions, LLC). Our structure: 15/15 licensing terms through
        08/10/2026 (15% of savings, 15% of revenue streams). ACS allocates 85% of its profits to Arboreum Impact
        Foundation (AIF)</p>
    <p>Post-deadline entries after 08/10/2026 transition to the 20/20 Model (20% of savings, 20% of revenue streams).
        Beginning 01/01/2027, the 30/30 Model applies (30% of savings, 30% of revenue streams).</p>

    <h3>III. System Status</h3>
    <p>Entities operating outside the 12/17/25 Standard are subject to public disclosure.</p>
